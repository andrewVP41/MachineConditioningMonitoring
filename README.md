# MachineConditioningMonitoring
This project simulates a solution to monitor the vibration of the machine using an accelerometer.

A machine such as a cutting tool usually vibrates at a small degree when in good conditions. When the machine becomes worn the vibration is unpredictable. In order to tell when the machine is worn or wearing we monitor the vibration. In this project, the user
presets the three threshold axes where the machine is in good condition within those threshold values. The vibration data is collected and stored in a file every ten seconds and displayed using a line chart. When the vibration values exceed the threshold values the user is alerted by a flashing LED and the data collection stops until the user services the machine and reset the monitoring system by pressing a designated button.
